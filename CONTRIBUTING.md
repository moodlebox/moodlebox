# Contributing to MoodleBox project

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the [MoodleBox project](https://github.com/martignoni/moodlebox). There is plenty of work to do and no big commitment is required: if all you do is fixing a typo in the documentation, you are a hero.

As for everything else in the project, the contributions to MoodleBox project are governed by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/martignoni/moodlebox/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

There are many ways to contribute. For example, you might:
- Add help and “how-to” articles to the documentation,
- Improve the translation of the documentation or translate it in other languages,
